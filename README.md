# ROS2 Dev Environment

A basic template Repo for a Docker focused ROS2 (Jazzy) development environment with a workspace folder for the ROS project files and some tool in the root directory for running everything.

Make sure to `chmod +m enter_container.sh` so you don't need to used bash to run it.
